# Kyocera-ab-tool

Kyocera-ab-tool or Kyocera Address Book tool is a tool written in go to 
facilitate the creation and maintainence of Kyocera scanner address books 
and their OneTouchKeys. 

I have created this tool in Python3 but have decided to recreate it in Go as 
a way to hone my Go skills, take advantage of Go's portability and the Go 
Gopher is also pretty cute.
